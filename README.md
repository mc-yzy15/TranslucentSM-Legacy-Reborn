# TranslucentSM
A lightweight utility that makes the Windows Start Menu translucent/transparent.<br>
This app utilizes XAML Diagnostics to inject a dll into a process and modifies the XAML.

> [!NOTE]
> This project will be inactive for a while. I'm currently busy.

# Settings
For now it uses registry to store the values. You can find them at ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\TranslucentSM```. <br>
There are two features currently. All values must be between 1 and 9.<br>
**After you change the settings, you must terminate StartMenuExperienceHost.exe and relaunch the app.**
### `TintLuminosityOpacity` 
Controls the luminosity brush (some secondary layer ig). 

### `TintOpacity`
